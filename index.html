<h1>Get Your Own Website For Free!</h1>
<h3>What you need to do:</h3>

    <li><h4>Create a word document that looks like the website you wanted.</h4></li>
    <li><h4>Add a title on the first line of your document that will appear on the tabs bar and a title on the second line of our document that will appear as part of the URL ("https://alanmencan.github.io/<u>The title</u>/").</h4></li>
    <li><h4>Send/share your document to "alanmencan@gmail.com".</h4></li>
    <li><h4>Wait until you got a email with the URL for your new website.</h4></li>
    <li><h4>Copy and paste the URL and you will see your new website!</h4></li>
</ol>
<br>
<h3>Please note:</h3>
<ol>
    <li><h4>The URL will always look like the following, with only a little part of it that you can control. Like this: "https://alanmencan.github.io/<u>This is the part of the URL that you can change</u>/".</h4></li>
    <li><h4>If something went wrong, you can send a new email with the URL to complain. I will try to fix it as soon as possible.</h4></li>
